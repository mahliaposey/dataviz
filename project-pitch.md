I want my data visualization to go with my thesis project about homicides. Homicide is the leading cause of death among black men ages 15-34. According to the Center for Disease Control there were 2,416 homicides in 2015 and 2,256 of those were gun related. Because of that, these women who are grieving their childâ€™s stolen future are fighting for equal protection under the law, not only by voicing concern for stricter gun control laws, but also for the government to recognize gun violence as a public health problem. I intend to use data from the Center for Disease Control and the Brady Campaign that will hopefully help me answer the question is there a correlation between the number of homicides by state and the number of public health services offered to victims. I want to use a map to show the daily death toll in the US by state and then show the number of health services each state has using the Victims of Violent Crime orginization as another resource, because every state has an office. I just want to be able to show people that this is a national problem that needs addressing beyond gun control laws.
